## 📋 How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: Drag and drop or click to select an image file
2. **EXIF Reading**: Automatically extracts GPS data from image metadata
3. **Coordinate Processing**: Converts DMS format to decimal degrees
4. **Address Lookup**: Uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim API for reverse geocoding
5. **Results Display**: Shows coordinates, address, and map links

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **EXIF Library**: [exif-js](https://github.com/exif-js/exif-js) v2.3.0
- **Geocoding API**: OpenStreetMap Nominatim (free, no API key required)
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with gradients and animations
- **Hosting**: Static hosting compatible (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone or download the HTML file
# Open in any modern web browser
# No build process required!
```

## 🖥️ Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome (recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Edge
- ✅ Mobile browsers

## 📸 Supported Image Formats

- JPEG/JPG (most common for GPS data)
- PNG
- TIFF
- WebP
- Any format supported by HTML5 File API

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **100% Client-Side**: No data sent to servers except for address lookup
- **No Storage**: Images are processed in browser memory only
- **No Tracking**: No analytics or tracking scripts
- **Open Source Geocoding**: Uses OpenStreetMap's free API

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Typical Use Cases

- **Digital Forensics**: Analyze photo locations
- **Travel Logging**: Extract locations from travel photos
- **Real Estate**: Get coordinates from property photos
- **Photography**: Organize photos by location
- **Mapping Projects**: Bulk coordinate extraction

### GPS Data Requirements

For GPS extraction to work, images must:
- Be taken with GPS-enabled device (smartphone/camera)
- Have location services enabled when photo was taken
- Contain unmodified EXIF metadata

## 🔧 Customization

### Styling
The CSS uses custom properties for easy theming:
```css
/* Main gradient colors */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);

/* Button colors */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #4facfe 0%, #00f2fe 100%);
```

### API Configuration
To use different geocoding services, modify the `fetchAddress()` function:
```javascript
// Current: OpenStreetMap Nominatim (free)
const response = await fetch(
    `https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?format=json&lat=${latitude}&lon=${longitude}`
);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No GPS Data Found**
- Image wasn't taken with GPS enabled
- EXIF data was stripped during editing/sharing
- Social media platforms often remove EXIF data

**Address Lookup Failed**
- Network connectivity issues
- Nominatim API temporarily unavailable
- Coordinates may be in remote areas without address data

**File Upload Issues**
- Ensure file is a valid image format
- Check file size (large files may take longer to process)
- Try different browser if issues persist

## 📊 API Limits

- **OpenStreetMap Nominatim**: 1 request per second limit
- **No API Key Required**: Free tier sufficient for normal usage
- **Fair Usage**: Please don't abuse the free service
